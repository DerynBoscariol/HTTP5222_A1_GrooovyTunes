        h1 Our Story 
        p Welcome to Grooovy Tunes, where music isn't just a business—it's a passion. Situated in the vibrant city of Toronto, our small, independent record store has been a cornerstone of the local music scene since 2005. From timeless classics to contemporary hits, we offer a diverse selection of vinyl records that cater to both seasoned collectors and new enthusiasts.
        h2 Our Orgins
        p Grooovy Tunes was founded by Charlotte and Kyle Turner, two lifelong music lovers with a shared vision. Kyle, a former music producer, and Charlotte, a passionate vinyl collector, combined their talents to create a unique space dedicated to the love of music. What began as a small collection of cherished records has grown into a beloved community hub, known for its eclectic mix and welcoming atmosphere.
